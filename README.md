[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/poppy-ergo-jr.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/poppy-ergo-jr/)

Poppy Ergo Jr robot is a small and low cost 6-degree-of-freedom robot arm. It consists of very simple shapes which can be easily 3D printed.

It works with Dynamixel XL-320 motors, and a Raspberry Pi for control.

It comes with three tools:
* a lampshade
* a graspper
* a pen holder

The Ergo Poppy Jr is ideal to start manipulating robots and learn robotic without difficulties.

It is particularly well suited for educational purposes (cheap, simple to assemble, and easily controllable) or can be a very nice desk decoration for geeks and makers...

You can get all the parts yourself following the [bill of materials (BOM)](doc/bom.md) and printing the [3D files](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-ergo-jr/releases/) available in the STL format.
